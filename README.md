# Smart Eco City Simulation

This project, developed for the Object-Oriented Programming (CS112) course, is a simulation where users can design, build, and manage a virtual city. The core focus is on achieving ecological balance and sustainability through strategic decision-making in infrastructure development, resource management, and environmental policies.

## Features

* **City Creation and Management:** Create and manage various aspects of your city, including finances and development.
* **Economic System:** Earn and spend in-game currency on buildings, transport, vehicles, and maintenance.
* **Building System:** Construct diverse building types including residential, commercial, and power plants (both conventional and renewable).
* **Transport System:** Develop road networks, railway networks, and airports, and manage vehicles (Electric and Internal Combustion Engine).
* **Environmental Simulation:** Track pollution, manage green spaces, and monitor your city's EcoScore, which reflects environmental health.
* **Player Progression:** Gain experience points, increase your Green Level based on EcoScore, and achieve goals for rewards.
* **Educational Eco Tips:** Access tips on sustainable practices.
* **Competition and Rankings:** Compare your city's EcoScore with others and view global rankings.

## Technologies Used

The simulation extensively applies Object-Oriented Programming principles, including Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
